Write up about PsikyoSH scaling, and how it works for TAP.

Provide a test suite to compare gameplay recordings of TAREF vs. running the
recording in a hacked TAP in MAME, with the recording written into TAP's ROM,
and the end-game-state written as well, with comparison code added to TAP, that
displays a "Replay Check: OK/FAIL" message. And vice versa.

Make all the non-reverse-engineered code const-correct. TAP's code was clearly
not const-correct, and preservation/documentation is a goal, so that code won't
be made const-correct.

Change some struct names to *Data, that describe other objects, and no "Data"
on structs that aren't extra data describing objects.

Init all data per the data in the program init data. And, to allow resets (and
easier porting to libretro) structure the game code to be in a library,
separate from main, so main can fully reset the game, with global inits being
run again.

Move the graphics code intended to be called by the game into the frontends, so
they can skip over directly emulating the PS6406B (except for the software and
PsikyoSH frontends); a frontend could then special-case graphics handling, such
as the line clear explosions, and skip over per-pixel palette handling. That
might allow the code to run at a playable speed on Raspberry Pi 3. But do
provide an optimized software renderer alongside the PS6406B emulating
renderer, so new platforms can be ported to without much difficulty, and
hopefully with decent performance.

Might be faster on Raspberry Pi 3 to dynamically generate shader programs that
are hard-coded with the palettes for graphics with highly variable palettes,
since all those graphics are 4bpp.

And the optimized renderers might be able to significantly reduce VRAM usage by
flushing the graphics cache on screen transitions, with longer-than-PsikyoSH
load times being acceptable at those points.

Investigate whether creating a texture per object is faster and uses less
memory than a sprite atlas. Check the max number of textures that raspi
supports first; if it's 894 or more, then it's guaranteed to work. Though
that'd not allow for really big batches of objects per draw call, but if sprite
graphics are cached for a duration of frames until they're freed, it might keep
memory usage on raspi down, which may matter more than precaching all graphics
for best execution speed. But try and keep palette-cycled objects rendered with
per-pixel paletted rendering, rather than caching the objects in 32bpp textures
(this resulted in the line clear explosions filling up all of memory in the
first draft). And, since the object handling will be done by the frontend
rather than with the PsikyoSH code, layers can be directly rendered in-order,
allowing per-layer batching.

This may be related to the "object group" (or whatever they are) functions,
that haven't been explored much yet.
